# Professionalism Study-

Black women often face discrimination because of their chosen hairstyle in the workplace. McCluney and Rabelo (2018) found that Black women can feel pressure to conform to certain behaviors and aesthetics to avoid standing out at work. Opie and Phillips (2015) revealed that the Black test candidates were rated as less professional when they had an Afrocentric hairstyle compared to a Eurocentric hairstyle. This current study assessed the extent to which an association can be established between types of hairstyles and professionalism.

Methodology
Examined the relationship between Eurocentric and Afrocentric hairstyles on perceived professionalism, friendliness and responsibility. 
Participants completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to determine whether implicit attitudes towards Eurocentric hairstyles and Afrocentric hairstyles affect the ability to sort one as more professional.

Results
A one-sample t-test was conducted to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in the IAT reaction time. Participants sorted Black women with Eurocentric hairstyles as professional more quickly (M= -0.59, SD= 0.38) than Black women with Afrocentric hairstyles as professional t(239) = -23.91, p= <.001.

Results for the explicit measure indicated that there was a significant effect of hairstyle on ranking, F (2, 478) = 10.144, p <.001, ges= .025. Post hoc testing indicated that the ranking for professionalism (M= 0.46, SD= 1.81) is significantly different from both friendliness (p <.001) and responsibility (p = .019). The test also indicated that the ranking for responsibility is significantly different from friendliness (M= -0.24, SD=1.85), p= .03

This study was conducted at the University of Florida under the supervison of Colin T. Smith, Ph.D and Louis Irving, Ph.D.
